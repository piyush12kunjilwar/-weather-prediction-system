Analysis:
- Perfect prediction for no-rain cases
- Complete failure to detect rain events
- Clear indication of model bias

## False Positives/Negatives Analysis

### False Negatives
- Count: 240 (all rain events)
- Impact: Critical failure in rain detection
- Cause: Class imbalance and model bias
- Effect: System would fail to predict any rain events

### False Positives
- Count: 0
- Impact: No false alarms
- Cause: Model's conservative prediction strategy
- Effect: System would never predict rain when it's not raining

## Comparison with Baseline Models

### Baseline 1: Meteorological Data Only
- Accuracy: 85.2%
- F1 Score (Rain): 0.15
- Pros: Faster training, simpler architecture
- Cons: Lower overall performance

### Baseline 2: Satellite Data Only
- Accuracy: 82.7%
- F1 Score (Rain): 0.12
- Pros: Captures spatial patterns
- Cons: Misses temporal patterns

### Current Combined Model
- Accuracy: 91.15%
- F1 Score (Rain): 0.0
- Pros: 
  - Highest overall accuracy
  - Combines both data sources
  - No false positives
- Cons:
  - Complete failure in rain detection
  - Long training time
  - Complex architecture

## Key Findings

1. **Class Imbalance Impact**
   - Severe impact on model's ability to detect rain
   - Model learned to always predict "no rain"
   - High accuracy is misleading due to imbalance

2. **Data Integration**
   - Combined model shows potential for higher accuracy
   - Integration of both data sources is valuable
   - Need better handling of imbalanced classes

3. **Architecture Considerations**
   - Current architecture may be too complex
   - Training time is significant
   - Need to balance complexity with performance

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Improvements**
   - Implement class weights in loss function
   - Use data augmentation for rain class
   - Try simpler model architectures

2. **Data Collection**
   - Collect more rain event data
   - Balance the dataset
   - Consider synthetic data generation

3. **Model Architecture**
   - Experiment with simpler architectures
   - Try different loss functions
   - Consider ensemble methods

4. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Focus on F1 score for rain class
   - Use precision-recall curves
   - Implement custom metrics for rain detection

## Conclusion

While the current model achieves high overall accuracy, it fails to address the core task of rain prediction. The severe class imbalance has led to a model that always predicts "no rain", making it ineffective for practical use. Future work should focus on addressing the class imbalance issue while maintaining the benefits of combining meteorological and satellite data.
